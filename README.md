# 📋 ToDo app

## 🧠 About

Simple one-page ToDo list with create, edit, finish and delete tasks functions. The data is stored in **LocalStorage**, so tasks remain after page reload. This is my first real project on pure **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** made as part of my learning path to becoming a fullstack web developer. I will scale this project by adding new features that I will learn.

- Adding new task

- Mark the task as completed
- Saving tasks in LocalStorage

## 🖥️ Stack
